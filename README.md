Miscellaneous notes

I really should find/write a good PIM, ideally something:
- file-based
- Git-backed
- easily accessible from a text editor
- that can be represented in a nice way for consulation
- written in Haskell

so for a start, a repository on GitHub with a bunch of files is not a bad option, and ticks most of these boxes.
